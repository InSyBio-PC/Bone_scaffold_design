# Scaffold Design Tool for Bone Tissue Engineering

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Scaffold Design Tool**, a machine learning (ML) and heuristic optimization-based framework developed to facilitate scaffold design for bone tissue engineering. The platform integrates two customizable tools:

- **Prediction Tool:** Forecasts scaffold properties (e.g., Bone Porosity, Connectivity Density) based on user-defined inputs (scaffold design parameters).

- **Optimization Tool:** Utilizes a heuristic genetic algorithm to refine scaffold parameters, enabling users to achieve desired design outcomes.

The tools are packaged in a user-friendly web interface (available at: https://diagnostics.insybio.com/), providing researchers with an accessible platform to design scaffolds that replicate the structural characteristics of healthy and pathological bone tissue.

## Key Features

### Prediction Tool
  - Developed using Elastic Net Regression models for robust prediction of scaffold properties.
  - Predicts key parameters such as:
    -   Bone Porosity
    -   Area-to-Volume Ratio
    -   Connectivity Density
    -   Trabecular Spacing
    -   Trabecular Thickness
  - Designed for seamless integration with 3D design tools like Meshmixer.

### Optimization Tool
  - Employs a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to identify optimal scaffold configurations.
  - Generates a Pareto front of solutions, allowing users to explore trade-offs between competing design objectives.

### Web Interface
  - Hosted on IBM Cloud with a scalable backend and interactive frontend.
  - Features an intuitive user interface for defining optimization parameters, visualizing the optimization process, and analyzing final configurations.

## System Architecture

- Frontend: Interacts with users to gather input parameters and display results.
- Backend: Processes user requests, runs Python-based algorithms, and communicates with the database.
- Database: Manages structured data storage for scaffold parameters, results, and logs.

The scaffold parameters are used as input into 3D modeling tools e.g. Meshmixer (blue orthogonal box) for scaffold design. Structural characteristics such as trabecular thickness and connectivity density are calculated (gray orthogonal box) and used to train Elastic Net Regression models with 5-fold cross-validation (red hexagonal box). The trained models underpin:

- **Prediction Tool:** Estimates scaffold performance based on user-provided design parameters (pink orthogonal box).
- **Optimization Tool:** Uses a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm to identify non-dominated solutions (pink orthogonal box).

Blue orthogonal shapes denote the algorithm’s steps, while the pink one denotes the output (Pareto Front). The light blue rhomboid denotes the termination criterion (number of generations reached). White orthogonal shapes denote a simplified example of an EA’s chromosome (scaffold configurations). The chromosome consists of the Sphere Diameter (SDm), Sphere Distance (SD), Delaunay Mesh Dimension (DMD), and Delaunay Point Spacing (DPS) variables (presented from left to right). Their range of values is indicated in the brackets above them.

## Tutorial for Using the Tools

### a. Model Training in R
[This step is optional. You can download the already trained models from the `models/` directory and use the tools directly.]

The Elastic Net Regression models for scaffold properties (Bone Porosity, Area-to-Volume Ratio, Connectivity Density, Trabecular Spacing, Trabecular Thickness) can be trained using the R script provided in the `scripts/` directory.

To train the models:

- Navigate to the `scripts/elastic_net_models` directory.
- Execute the R scripts (area volume.R , bone porosity.R) with the required input data.

### b. Prediction Tool

The Prediction Tool forecasts scaffold properties based on user-provided scaffold design parameters.

**Command (bash):**

    python3 scaffold_design.py --sphere_diameter 0.4 --sphere_distance 0.4 --delaunay_mesh 0.21 --delaunay_spacing 0.1 --output_folder /PATH/folder/ --model_dir /PATH/model_folder --scaling_dir /PATH/scaling_folder

**Arguments:**

| Argument           | Description                                                | Default Value / Range of Values |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|

### c. Optimization Tool

The Optimization Tool refines scaffold parameters to meet user-defined property targets using a heuristic genetic algorithm.
